# Appium Mobile Automation Framework

A hybrid automation framework built using **Java**, **TestNG**, and **Appium** for testing Android mobile applications. The project follows modular design principles with a strong focus on reusability, maintainability, and reporting.

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Java** + **TestNG**
- **Appium** for mobile automation
- **ExtentReports** for HTML reports
- **Console Logs** for terminal-level test insights
- **Apache POI** for reading test data from Excel
- **Maven** for build and dependency management
- **Page Object Model** for code structure

---

## ✅ Features

- **Data-Driven Testing:** Fetches login and other input data from an external Excel file
- **Configurable Setup:** Uses `config.properties` for device, app, and environment settings
- **Reusable Utilities:**
  - `ScrollUtil`, `WaitUtil`, `ScreenshotUtil`, etc.
  - Centralized Excel handling with `TestDataUtil`
- **Screenshots on Failure:** Automatically captures screenshots for failed test cases
- **Extent Reports:** Test steps and status are logged into an interactive HTML report
- **Console Logs:** Lightweight feedback during test execution
